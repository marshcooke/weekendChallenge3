# Project completed during weekend 3 at Prime
While enrolled at Prime Digital Academy, we took on weekend code challenges. Week 3 is outlined below:

# Weekend Challenge 3

## The To-Do App

You are going to create a TO DO application. This type of application is very common to tackle when learning a new language, which makes it extremely valuable to work through for the first time. Chances are good that at some point in your career you will tackle this again while learning another language.

## Here are the specific components for the challenge:

[X] Create a front end experience (e.g. a form) that allows a user to create a Task.
[X] When the Task is created, it should be stored inside of a database.
[X] Whenever a Task is created, the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.
[X] Each Task should have an option to "Complete".
[X] Each Task should have an option to "Delete".
[X] When a Task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end. (For example, the background of the task container could change from gray to green.) The complete option should be checked off. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete.
[X] Whether or not a Task is complete should also be stored in the database.
[X] Deleting a Task should remove it both from the front end as well as the database.

[X] Make sure that you also show us your best styling chops.

## Database Structure

[X] Please include a database.sql text file in your repo that includes all of your CREATE TABLE queries. This is so we can re-create your database while testing your app.

### HARD MODE

[X] Adjust the logic so that completed tasks are brought to the bottom of the page, where the remaining tasks left to complete are brought to the top of the list.

### PRO MODE

[X] In whatever fashion you would like, create an "are you sure: yes / no" option when deleting a task. Once again, you can interpret this however you would like.
